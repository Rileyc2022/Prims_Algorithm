# Prim's Algorithm

This is my Javascript implementation of Prim's algorithm.

"Prim's algorithm (also known as Jarn√≠k's algorithm) is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time, from an arbitrary starting vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another vertex" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding)). 


To run:
```
git clone https://github.com/Rileyc2022/Prims_Algorithm
cd Prims_Algorithm
node Main.js
```
The console will output the minimum spanning tree for the matrix in matrix.txt.
